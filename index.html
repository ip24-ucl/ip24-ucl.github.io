      <td>  Several different techniques exist for indirectly recovering the optical absorption and/or scattering coefficients of biological objects, and from there to inferring concentrations of chromophores of interest, from observations of transmitted and reflected light at multiple wavelengths; these include diffuse optical tomography, fluorescence optical tomography, and bioluminescence tomography.
These modalities exhibit a tradeoff between greater contrast against lower resolution due
to increased scattering. Acoustic waves also have a long tradition in imaging with both qualitative
and quantitative interpretations. These concepts are combined in photo-acoustic tomography
(PAT) which generates contrast with optical photons and develops resolution using ultrasound.
In this talk I review some recent progress in these areas including the acceleration of PAT using
Compressed Sensing and Machine Learning techniques.

       Several applications in medical imaging and non-destructive material
testing lead to inverse elliptic coefficient problems, where an unknown
coefficient function in an elliptic PDE is to be determined from partial
knowledge of its solutions. This is usually a highly non-linear ill
posed inverse problem, for which unique reconstructability results,
stability and resolution estimates and global convergence of numerical
methods are very hard to achieve. In this talk we will review some
recent results on Loewner Monotonicity and Convexity that may help in
overcoming these issues.

       We present conditional stability estimates for unique continuation and Cauchy problems associated to the Poisson equation in ultra-weak variational form. Numerical approximations are obtained as minima of regularized least squares functionals. The arising dual norms are replaced by discretized dual norms, which leads to a mixed formulation in terms of trial- and test-spaces. <br>
For stable pairs of such spaces, and a proper choice of the regularization parameter, the $L_2$-error on a subdomain in the obtained numerical approximation can be bounded by the best possible fractional power of the sum of the data error and the error of best approximation. Compared to the use of a standard variational formulation, the latter two errors are measured in weaker norms. To avoid the use of $C^1$-finite element test spaces, nonconforming finite element test spaces can be applied as well. They either lead to the qualitatively same error bound, or in a simplified version, to such an error bound modulo an additional data oscillation term. Numerical results illustrate our theoretical findings.

     We consider finite element approximation in the context of the ill-posed elliptic
unique continuation problem and introduce a notion of optimal error estimates
that includes convergence with respect to a mesh parameter and perturbations
in data. The rate of convergence is determined by the conditional stability of the
underlying continuous problem and the polynomial order of the finite element
approximation space. We present a stabilized finite element method satisfying
the optimal estimate and discuss a proof showing that no finite element approximation can converge at a better rate.

      In this talk, we are interested in the unique continuation problem for the Stokes equations in the case where the local measurement is part of a large family of measurements. We propose a numerical resolution of this problem by introducing a FE approximation of an optimization problem regularized by the database through a term involving the POD basis associated to the database. We will present to what extent the resolution is improved both theoretically and numerically by the additional knowledge of the database.

     Cauchy problems for the Brinkman equations governing the flow of fluids in porous
media are investigated. The physical scenario corresponds to situations where part of the boundary 
of the fluid domain is hostile or inaccessible, whilst on the remaining friendly part of the
boundary we prescribe or measure both the fluid velocity and traction. The resulting mathematical formulation 
leads to a linear but ill-posed inverse problem. A convergent algorithm based on
solving two sub sequences of mixed direct problems is developed. The direct solver is based on
the method of fundamental solutions which is a meshless boundary collocation method. Since the
investigated problem is ill posed, the iterative process is stopped according to the discrepancy
principle at a threshold given by the amount of noise with which the input measured data is
contaminated in order to prevent the manifestation of instability. Results inverting both exact
and noisy data for two and three-dimensional problems demonstrate the convergence and stability
of the proposed numerical algorithm.

       Helioseismology is the study of the interior of the Sun given observations of oscillations of the solar surface. Due to the lack of controlled sources, passive imaging techniques are typically used, and correlations of observed oscillations are considered as input data of the inverse problem.
<br>
Numerical reconstructions are challenging since such correlation data are extremely noisy and high dimensional. They depend of 5 variables (one frequency variable and 2x2=4 surface variables), and it is computationally unfeasibly to fully compute and store them in a preprocessing step. Classically, quantitative reconstructions in local helioseismology are achieved by computing a moderate number of linear functionals of the correlation data which can, e.g., be interpreted as travel times of certain types of waves, and then solving inverse problems with such reduced data. However, it can be shown that these procedures waste lots of the information contained in the correlation data. As an alternative, helioseismic holography has been used successfully since more than two decades to compute <i>qualitative</i> images of, e.g., the far side of the Sun, without the need of computing correlation data as preprocessing step.
<br>
We present a new mathematical interpretation of (certain versions of) helioseismic holography, and based on this interpretation we propose an iterative method which is provably convergent. In particular, it provides not only qualitative, but also quantitatively correct reconstructions of the solar interior and the far side. It takes advantage of the full information content of correlation data without the need to compute these data in a preprocessing step, and as a consequence, it achieves significantly improved resolution compared to traditional approaches.

      We consider the quantitative inverse problem for the reconstruction of physical properties of a medium are from wave measurements. We consider linear viscoelasticity to model the propagation of waves in solid materials, taking into account attenuation and anisotropy of the media. In this work, we employ the time-harmonic wave equations to facilitate working with different attenuation models, which are frequency-dependent. For numerical discretization, we use the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method which employs static condensation to reduce the computational cost. We perform quantitative inversion by following a minimization algorithm where the elastic properties are iteratively updated. We carry out reconstructions with attenuation model uncertainty, and highlight the importance of considering anisotropy in the model. We provide synthetic experiments for ultrasound imaging of breast samples.

    We consider a unique continuation problem subject to the wave equation: 
Given measurements of the solution in a subset of the space-time cylinder but no initial data, we aim to 
extend the solution as far as possible beyond the data set - ideally to the entire cylinder. It is well-known that this maximal 
extension is indeed possible in a Lipschitz-stable manner, provided that additional measurements of the solution on the 
lateral boundary of the cylinder are available (and certain geometric conditions are fulfilled). In this setting, many innovative 
numerical methods have been proposed in recent years to compute the extension numerically. 
    <br>
 However, the question what happens if no measurements on the boundary are available seems to be far less understood. In 
this talk we provide analytical and numerical results which show that in this case the solution can be extended in a Hölder-stable 
manner to a certain proper(!) subset of the space-time domain. Trying to extend further leads to degeneration of the stability 
until a logarithmic regime is reached and the accuracy of the corresponding extension becomes too poor to suit practical purposes.  
We present a possible remedy for this problem: If one can explicitly construct a small finite dimensional space in which
the trace of the solution on the boundary can be approximated with high-accuracy, then the solution can be recovered with 
Lipschitz stability everywhere. This is an extremely powerful yet dangerous technique as its success hinges entirely on a 
proper choice of this finite dimensional space.

     We discretize a unique continuation problem subject to a transient equation and present the associated numerical analysis. This unique continuation problem consists in reconstructing the solution of the equation in a target space-time subdomain given its (noised) value in a subset of the computational domain. Both initial and boundary data can be unknown. In the sequel, both the heat and the wave equations will be considered.
<br>
The corresponding continuous problem is ill-posed and does not necessarily have a standard (Lipschitz) stability estimate. Instead, we can have a conditional (Hölder) stability estimate, so that an a priori estimate on the solution is needed to bound its norm in the target subdomain.
<br>
The considered discretization method uses discontinuous high-order polynomials in space and in time. Polynomial variables attached to the faces of the mesh are also considered. The discrete solution is sought as a saddle-point of a Lagrangian functional. Moreover, some stabilization terms are considered to regularize the ill-posed problem.
<br>
We establish optimal a priori error bounds for a weak (residual) norm. This first result is proved by means of standard arguments such as inf-sup stability and consistency of the discretization. The conditional stability estimate of the continuous problem is then used to obtain a priori error bounds in energy norm. These error bounds optimally account for the ill-posedness of the continuous problem. Some numerical experiments are presented to check the actual efficiency of the method.

     Considering a simple linear model of ocean, we wish to identify the bottom deformation due to a tsunami from the observation of the perturbed
free surface. In this preliminary work, we restrict to a time harmonic situation. This ill-posed problem is addressed with the help of a mixed formulation of the Tikhonov regularization, the Morozov principle being used to compute the regularization parameter through a duality approach. One step of this Morozov process requires to compute a lifting function which is associated with some noisy Neumann data and convert the noise amplitude of the surface data to a noise amplitude of the volume lifting function. We compare a deterministic and a probabilistic conversion, the second one improving the quality of the identification.
